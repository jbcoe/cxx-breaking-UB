## TL;DR

Undefined behaviour can be exploited to optimise code and used by compiler and
library implementations to help find bugs.  Can we rely on such optimisations
and bug-squashing abilities after a compiler upgrade?

## Introduction

Should C++ guarantee that undefined behaviour remains undefined behaviour as
the language and library evolve?

We have recently seen papers that propose rendering currently undefined
behaviour as well-defined
[[1]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0903r1.pdf)
[[2]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html). In
the ensuing discussions, concerns were raised about the possibility of degraded
run-time performance (e.g. due to missed optimisation opportunities) and lost
ability to detect bugs (e.g. due to tools like `ubsan` being increasingly
constrained). Rather than have precedent determined by a small number of
concrete cases, we would like to discuss more generally the issue of changes to
the language and library that aim to eliminate undefined behaviour.

In this paper, following the spirit of
[[3]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0684r2.pdf) and
[[4]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0921r0.pdf), we
invite the combined evolution groups to discuss, if not determine,
(non-binding) policy on preserving or eliminating undefined behaviour.

## Contracts, preconditions and postconditions

Contract-based-programming is a software design method where formal
requirements and guarantees are given for functions. Contract design for C++ is
described in
[[5]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0380r1.pdf) and
[[6]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0542r1.html) and
its impact considered in
[[7]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0788r0.pdf).

From the proposed wording in
[[6]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0542r1.html):

"A precondition is a predicate that should hold upon entry into a function. It
expresses a function's expectation on its arguments and/or the state of objects
that may be used by the function."

"A postcondition is a predicate that should hold upon exit from a function. It
expresses the conditions that a function should ensure for the return value
and/or the state of objects that may be used by the function."

A function with preconditions is said to have a _narrow contract_. Violating
the preconditions on such a function may result in an ill-formed program and
associated compile-time-diagnostics or in undefined behaviour. 

When there are no preconditions on a function's arguments, the function is said
to have a _wide contract_. There may be input values for
wide-contract-functions that result in exceptions being thrown but such
behaviour is always well-defined. `std::vector` has `operator[]` and `at` to
perform index-access with narrow and wide contracts respectively.

### Changes to contracts

In an updated version of the C++ Standard we may wish to consider making
changes to a function's preconditions and postconditions.

Making preconditions stricter would be a silent breaking change: a previously
valid program would now invoke undefined behaviour.  We would expect such a
proposed change to be rejected.

Relaxing postconditions would similarly be a silent breaking change: a
previously valid program that relied on the postconditions of one function to
satisfy the preconditions of another would now invoke undefined behaviour.  We
would similarly expect such a proposed change to be rejected.

Relaxing preconditions would not render any existing program invalid or
undefined.  We would expect such a change to be accepted so long as it was not
accompanied by relaxing of postconditions.

Making postconditions stricter would similarly not render any existing program
invalid or undefined.  We would expect such a change to be accepted.

Relaxing preconditions and restricting postconditions may render some existing
programs less-than optimally efficient as they may contain run-time checks for
behaviour that is now guaranteed. 

There may be other factors to consider though. People may be _relying_ on
undefined behaviour for trapping errors or for optimisation.

## Sanitizers and assertions

The undefined behaviour sanitizers from GCC
[[8]](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html) and
Clang [[9]](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) can be
used to produce an instrumented build in which some instances of undefined
behaviour will be detected and the program terminated with a helpful message.

Standard library implementations can be augmented with debug checks and
assertions to ensure that preconditions are true.  For instance, calling
`std::vector::operator[](size_t i)` with `i` greater than the size of the
vector will be caught in a debug build using Microsoft's Standard Library
implementation.

Builds with sanitizers and active assertions are commonly used by engineers to
identify and eliminate bugs. 

## Case studies

The following case studies are recent examples of proposed changes to undefined
behaviour. Both cases would be considered acceptable by the contract-based
criteria we outlined above but have led to considerable discussion.

### Relaxing a precondition for `std::string_view`

P0903
[[1]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0903r1.pdf)
proposes to widen the contract of the `string_view(const char*)` constructor to
make `string_view((const char*)nullptr)` well-defined. In this paper, we take
no position on whether this should be adopted, but present some of the
arguments raised for and against adoption from the perspective of widening the
interface.

Widening the contract of `string_view`'s pointer constructor is a non-breaking
change as it does not result in relaxation of postconditions: `string_view` can
already be constructed in a state where it has a `NULL` data member using the
pointer and size constructor (`string_view(const char*, size_t)`).

Widening the contract of `string_view` will impose an additional run-time check
as the now potentially `NULL` pointer will need to be checked.  Making
previously undefined behaviour well-defined will make some bugs harder to find
as it will no longer be possible to assert that the pointer in non-null.

The last point is sufficiently subtle for an example to be illuminating.
Consider the following code:

```c++
std::string processName(std::string_view username);

std::string getUserName(const UserConfig& user_config) {
  const char* username = nullptr;
  
  switch (user_config.user_type) {
    case UserType::FOO:
      // External library C function
      getFooName(user_config.uuid, &username); 
      break;
    case UserType::BAR:
      // Programmer error: forgot to call getBarName
      break;
  }

  return processName(username);
}
```

Let us assume that `getFooName` and `getBarName` always set their second
parameter to point to a valid C string (possibly empty, i.e. `"\0"`).

In this case, the programmer forgot to handle the `BAR` case properly, and the
call to `processName` may construct a `string_view` with a `nullptr` argument.
In the current specification, passing `nullptr` to the single-parameter
constructor for `string_view` violates a precondition and may result in
undefined behaviour when attempting to calculate the length of the string view
(which will involve dereferencing the pointer). This provides an opportunity
for a library implementation to emit diagnostics that could guide the developer
towards the source of the problem.

By making this constructor valid, widening the contract to internally
reinterpret it as a call to `string_view(nullptr, 0)`, we would eliminate the
possibility for the library to flag this for attention, and instead produce an
empty string view, a situation that is much harder to debug as the cause and
effect may be separated by some considerable distance or time.

### Defining the behaviour for signed integer overflow

P0907R0
[[2]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html)
originally proposed to make signed integer overflow well-defined such that it
behaves as for unsigned integers on overflowing operations (i.e. overflow in
the positive direction wraps around from the maximum integer value for the type
back to the minimum and vice versa for overflow in the opposite direction).
This was subsequently removed from the proposal following various concerns
raised from EWG, SG6 and SG12. Below we present a quick overview of the reasons
for removal of the sub-proposal defining signed integer overflow.

According to the earlier contract-based arguments, making integer overflow
well-defined is an non-breaking change as it relaxes preconditions and does not
further restrict postconditions - there is no previously valid program that
would be rendered invalid by making integer overflow well defined.

The primary complaint against defining overflow for signed integers was lost
optimisation opportunities and the subsequent expected performance degradation.
Modern compilers take advantage of the currently undefined behaviour on signed
integer overflow for a variety of optimisations.

Possibly the most crucial of the currently permitted optimisations is loop
analysis. A simple `for` loop such as the one below would be adversely affected:

```c++
signed int foo(signed int i) noexcept
{
  signed int j, k = 0;
  for (j = i; j < i + 10; ++j) ++k;
  return k;
}
```

We might expect that the function `foo` could be trivially reduced to a simple
`return 10` statement during a flow-analysis optimisation pass. Indeed, with
the current language rules, this is what most modern compilers will emit.
However, under the changes proposed in P0907R0
[[2]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html)
this would no longer be a valid optimisation as there are some inputs which
would overflow.

There are many other optimisation opportunities that are similarly reliant on
the undefined behaviour of signed integer overflow. Below is an (incomplete)
summary of other optimisations gathered from
[[10]](https://kristerw.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/how-undefined-signed-overflow-enables.html):

- `(x * c) == 0` can be optimised to `x == 0`, eliding the multiplication.
- `(x * c_1) / c_2` can be optimised to `x * (c_1 / c_2)` if `c_1` is divisible by `c_2`.
- `(-x) / (-y)` can be optimised to `x / y`.
- `(x + c) < x` can be optimised to `false` if `c > 0` or `true` otherwise.
- `(x + c) <= x` can be optimised to `false` if `c >= 0` or `true` otherwise.
- `(x + c) > x` can be optimised to `true` if `c >= 0` and `false` otherwise.
- `(x + c) >= x` can be optimised to `true` if `c > 0` and `false` otherwise.
- `-x == -y` can be optimised to `x == y`.
- `x + c > y` can be optimised to `x + (c - 1) >= y`.
- `x + c <= y` can be optimised to `x + (c - 1) < y`.
- `(x + c_1) == c_2` can be optimised to `x == (c_2 - c_1)`.
- `(x + c_1) == (y + c_2)` can be optimised to `x == (y + (c_2 - c_1))` if `c_1 <= c_2`.
- Various value-range specific optimisations such as:
  - Changing comparisons `x < y` to `true` or `false`. 
  - Changing `min(x,y)` or `max(x,y)` to `x` or `y` if the ranges do not overlap.
  - Changing `abs(x)` to `x` or `-x` if the range does not cross 0.
  - Changing `x / c` to `x >> log2(c)` if `x > 0` 
  - Changing `x % c` to `x & (c-1)` if `x > 0` and the constant `c` is a power of 2.

## Polls

- Undefined behaviour should be preserved from one version of the C++ Standard
  to the next.

- Compiler / library diagnostics that allow undefined behaviour to be trapped
  should be considered when determining if a new feature is non-breaking.

- Compiler / library optimisations that exploit undefined behaviour should be
  considered when determining if a new feature is non-breaking.
